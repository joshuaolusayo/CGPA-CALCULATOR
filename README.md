# To-Do-List

This helps the user to calculate their CGPA.

The CGPA is calculated using the American (4.0) scale and the British (5.0) scale. That means students can know their CGPA in the two different formats.


Requirements:

Course Code, Unit and Score.

The user have to insert the Course Code which must not start with a number. For instance, a Course Code can be in the form of MAT111 or BIO491.

The Unit of each course must not exceed 10. This means each course unit must be between the range of 1 and 10 inclusive. Also, the value must be an integer. If it is not, the corresponding decimal number will be round down to the nearest integer.

The Score is the cummulative of the assignment, test, exam and practical. Therefore, the maximum score of each course is assumed to be 100% while the minimum is assumed to be 1.


I have also tried to put the class of grade of each student based on the values that are supplied as input to the calculator. That means, a student will not only be able to know his/her CGPA but also the grade they belong to. For instance, people using 5.0 scale will be able to know if they are in first class, second class upper, and so on.

The students using 4.0 scale will also be able to know if their final grade is A+, A, B, B- and so on also.

Another thing packaged in this program is that you will be able to know the number of unit passed and the number of units failed. A student is assumed to fail a course if the person gets below 40 (for British 5.0 scale) and 60 (for American 4.0 scale).


This program was built with HTML, CSS and JAVASCRIPT
